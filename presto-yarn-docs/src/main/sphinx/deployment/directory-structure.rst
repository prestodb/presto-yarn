Presto Installation Directory Structure
=======================================

If you use Slider scripts or use Ambari slider view to set up Presto on YARN, Presto is going to be installed using the Presto server tarball (and not the rpm). Installation happens when the YARN application is launched and you can find the Presto server installation directory under the ``yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs`` on your YARN nodemanager nodes. If for example, your ``yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs`` is ``/mnt/hadoop/nm-local-dirs`` and ``app_user`` is ``yarn``, you can find Presto is installated under ``/mnt/hadoop-hdfs/nm-local-dir/usercache/yarn/appcache/application_<id>/container_<id>/app/install/presto-server-<version>``. The first part of this path (till the container_id) is called the AGENT_WORK_ROOT in Slider and so in terms of that, Presto is available under ``AGENT_WORK_ROOT/app/install/presto-server-<version>``.

Normally for a tarball installed Presto the catalog, plugin and lib directories will be subdirectories under the main presto-server installation directory. The same case here, the catalog directory is at ``AGENT_WORK_ROOT/app/install/presto-server-<version>/etc/catalog``, plugin and lib directories are created under ``AGENT_WORK_ROOT/app/install/presto-server-<version>/plugin`` and ``AGENT_WORK_ROOT/app/install/presto-server-<version>/lib`` directories respectively. The launcher scripts used to start the Presto Server will be at ``AGENT_WORK_ROOT/app/install/presto-server-<version>/bin`` directory.

The Presto logs are available at locations based on your configuration for data directory. If you have it configured at ``/var/lib/presto/data`` in ``appConfig.json`` then you will have Presto logs at ``/var/lib/presto/data/var/log/``.
