Presto App Package configuration
================================

There are some sample configuration options files available at ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources`` directory in the repository. ``appConfig.json`` and ``resources-[singlenode|mutlinode].json`` files are the two major configuration files you need to configure before you can get Presto running on YARN. Copy the ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/appConfig.json`` and ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/resources-[singlenode|multinode].json`` to a local file at a location where you are planning to run Slider. Name them as ``appConfig.json`` and ``resources.json``. Update these sample json files with whatever configurations you want to have for Presto. If you are ok with the default values in the sample file you can just use them as-is. 

The "default" values listed for the sections [appConfig.json](#appconfig) and [resources.json](#resources) are from ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/appConfig.json`` and ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/resources-multinode.json`` files respectively. These default values will also be used for installation using [Ambari](#sliderview) Slider View.

``Note``: If you are planning to use Ambari for your installation skip to this [section](#sliderview). Changing these files manually is needed only if you are going to install Presto on YARN manually using Slider. If installing via Ambari, you can change these configurations from the Slider view.

Follow the steps here and configure the presto-yarn configuration files to match your cluster requirements. Optional ones are marked (optional). Please do not change any variables other than the ones listed below.

appConfig.json
--------------

#. ``site.global.app_user`` (default - ``yarn``): This is the user which will be launching the YARN application for Presto. So all the Slider commands (using ``bin/slider`` script) will be run as this user. Make sure that you have a HDFS home directory created for the ``app_user``. Eg: for user ``yarn`` create ```/user/yarn``` with ```yarn``` user as an owner.

::

   hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/yarn
   hdfs dfs -chown yarn:yarn /user/yarn


  ``Note``: For operations involving Hive connector in Presto, especially INSERT, ALTER TABLE etc, it may require that the user running Presto has access to HDFS directories like Hive warehouse directories. So make sure that the ``app_user`` you set has appropriate access permissions to those HDFS directories. For eg: ``/apps/hive/warehouse`` is usually where Presto user will need access for various DML operations involving Hive connector and is owned by ``hdfs`` in most cases. In that case, one way to fix the permission issue is to set ``site.global.app_user`` to user ``hdfs`` and also create ``/user/hdfs`` directory in HDFS if not already there (as above). You will also need to  run any slider scripts(bin/slider) as user ``hdfs`` in this case.

#. ``site.global.user_group`` (default - ``hadoop``): The group owning the application.

#. ``site.global.data_dir`` (default - ``/var/lib/presto/data``): The data directory configured should be pre-created on all nodes and must be owned by user ``yarn``, otherwise slider will fail to start Presto with permission errors.

#. ``site.global.config_dir`` (default - ``/var/lib/presto/etc``): The configuration directory on the cluster where the Presto config files node.properties, jvm.config, config.properties and connector configuration files are deployed. These files will have configuration values created from templates ``presto-yarn-package/package/templates/*.j2`` and other relevant ``appConfig.json`` parameters.

#. ``site.global.singlenode`` (default - ``true``): If set to true, the node used act as both coordinator and worker (singlenode mode). For multi-node set up, this should be set to false.

#. ``site.global.presto_query_max_memory`` (default - ``50GB``): This will be used as ``query.max-memory`` in Presto's config.properties file.

#. ``site.global.presto_query_max_memory_per_node`` (default - ``1GB``):  This will be used as ``query.max-memory-per-node`` in Presto's config.properties file.

#. ``site.global.presto_server_port`` (default - ``8080``): Presto server's http port.

#. ``site.global.catalog`` (optional) (default - configures ``tpch`` connector): It should be of the format (note the single quotes around each value) - {'connector1' : ['key1=value1', 'key2=value2'..], 'connector2' : ['key1=value1', 'key2=value2'..]..}. This will create files connector1.properties, connector2.properties for Presto with entries key1=value1 etc.
                                                                                
::
   
    "site.global.catalog": "{'hive': ['connector.name=hive-cdh5', 'hive.metastore.uri=thrift://${NN_HOST}:9083'], 'tpch': ['connector.name=tpch']}"


  ``Note``: The ``NN_HOST`` used in ``hive.metastore.uri`` is a variable for your HDFS Namenode and this expects that your hive metastore is up and running on your HDFS Namenode host. You do not have to replace that with your actual Namenode hostname. This variable will be substituted with your Namenode hostname during runtime. If you have hive metastore running elsewhere make sure you update ``NN_HOST`` with the appropriate hostname.

#. ``site.global.jvm_args`` (default - as in example below): This configures Presto ``jvm.config`` file and default heapsize is ``1GB``. Since Presto needs the ``jvm.config`` format to be a list of options, one per line, this property must be a String representation of list of strings. Each entry of this list will be a new line in your jvm.config. For example the configuration should look like:

::

   "site.global.jvm_args": "['-server', '-Xmx1024M', '-XX:+UseG1GC', '-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M', '-XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit', '-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent', '-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError', '-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=kill -9 %p']",


#. ``site.global.additional_node_properties`` and ``site.global.additional_config_properties`` (optional) (default - None): Presto launched via Slider will use ``config.properties`` and ``node.properties`` created from templates ``presto-yarn-package/package/templates/config.properties*.j2`` and ``presto-yarn-package/package/target/node.properties.j2`` respectively. If you want to add any additional properties to these configuration files, add ``site.global.additional_config_properties`` and ``site.global.additional_node_properties`` to your ``appConfig.json``. The value of these has to be a string representation of an array of entries (key=value) that has to go to the ``.properties`` file. Eg:

::
   
   "site.global.additional_config_properties": "['task.max-worker-threads=50', 'distributed-joins-enabled=true']"


#. ``site.global.plugin`` (optional) (default - None): This allows you to add any additional jars you want to copy to plugin ``presto-server-<version>/plugin/<connector>`` directory in addition to what is already available there. It should be of the format {'connector1' : ['jar1', 'jar2'..], 'connector2' : ['jar3', 'jar4'..]..}. This will copy jar1, jar2 to Presto plugin directory at plugin/connector1 directory and jar3, jar4 at plugin/connector2 directory. Make sure you have the plugin jars you want to add to Presto available at ```presto-yarn-package/src/main/slider/package/plugins/``` prior to building the presto-yarn app package and thus the app package built ``presto-yarn-package-<version>-<presto-version>.zip`` will have the jars under ```package/plugins``` directory.

::
   
   "site.global.plugin": "{'ml': ['presto-ml-${presto.version}.jar']}",


#. ``site.global.app_name`` (optional) (default - ``presto-server-0.130``) This value should be the name of the tar.gz file contained within the zip file produced by presto-yarn (in package/files/ within the zip). If you use a custom presto server distribution or anything other than the default presto-yarn package settings, please be sure to modify this.

#. ``application.def`` For Slider users, when the command to install the presto package is run, the logs will explicitly tell the user which value to use for this parameter. Changing this is only required if you are using a custom built presto package.

#. ``java_home`` (default - ``/usr/lib/jvm/java``): Presto requires Java 1.8. So make jdk8 the default java or add it to ``java_home`` here
    
#. Variables in ``appConfig.json`` like ``${COORDINATOR_HOST}``, ``${AGENT_WORK_ROOT}`` etc. do not need any substitution and will be appropriately configured during runtime.

resources.json
--------------

The configuration here can be added either globally (for COORDINATOR and WORKER) or for each component. Refer [configuration](#advanced) section for further details.

#. ``yarn.vcores`` (default - ``1``): By default this is set globally.
 
#. ``yarn.component.instances`` (default - ``1`` for COORDINATOR and ``3`` for WORKER): The multinode ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/rresources-multinode.json`` sample file is now configured for a 4 node cluster where there will be 1 coordinator and 3 workers with strict placement policy, meaning, there will be one component instance running on every node irrespective of failure history. If there are insufficient number of nodemanager nodes in your cluster to accomodate the number of workers requested, the application launch will fail. The number of workers could be ``number of nodemanagers in your cluster - 1``, with 1 node reserved for the coordinator, if you want Presto to be on all YARN nodes. If you want to deploy Presto on a single node (``site.global.singlenode`` set to true), make sure you set 1 for the COORDINATOR and just not add the WORKER component section (Refer  ``presto-yarn-package/src/main/resources/resources-singlenode.json``). You can also just set ``yarn.component.instances`` to 0 for WORKER in this case.
 
#. ``yarn.memory`` (default - ``1500MB``): The heapsize defined as -Xmx of ``site.global.jvm_args`` in ``appConfig.json``, is used by the Presto JVM itself. Slider suggests that the value of ``yarn.memory`` must be bigger than this heapsize. The value of ``yarn.memory`` MUST be bigger than the heap size allocated to any JVM and Slider suggests using atleast 50% more appears to work, though some experimentation will be needed.

#. ``yarn.label.expression`` (optional) (default - ``coordinator`` for COORDINATOR and ``worker`` for WORKER``): See [label](#label) section for details.

Now you are ready to deploy Presto on YARN either manually or via Ambari.
